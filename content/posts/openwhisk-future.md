OpenWhisk community is nowadays getting more consistent on the new design of architecture for performance improvement. To fill all the gaps from idea into implementation, there might be helpful if a mid ground exist to clear more issues. Hence, I've worked on prototyping performance improvement in real but not that comprehensive. However, hope this prototype hold a place for deeper discussion and discover all issues might meet in the future. Objectives:

* Draft as an experimental prototype of OpenWhisk future architecture, for knowing all issues might meet.
* Might be a place for discussion.
